# General Systems Vehicles Culture Ships

In case you ever needed Iain M. Banks's Culture ship names as a service. Names sourced from the pleasingly extensive [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series) listing them. Sadly a closed set.

## Usage

```rust
let shipname = gsv_culture_ships::random();
println!("Out-of-context problem observed by {}.", shipname);
```
